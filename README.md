## Project Name
Dough Boys Restaurant Website

---

## Project Overview

The Dough Boys Website is a simple business website developed to meet the needs of a restaurant client. The purpose of the application is to present the company’s food products in a clean, organized, and visually appealing manner while making important information easily accessible to customers.

The intended users of the website are current and potential customers of the Dough Boys restaurant. The site includes a menu section showcasing food offerings, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section to address common customer inquiries, and a section highlighting the company’s social media presence. All client requirements were met as outlined in the original project plan.

Planned future improvements include adding a drop-down menu that allows customers to connect directly to third-party online ordering services.
